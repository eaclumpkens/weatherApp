[launch project](eaclumpkens.github.io/dayplanner/)

>In this project I utilized Open Weather API to render current and near future climate data on the user's input of a city name. A search history is automatically updated and rendered, the most recently searched item being saved to local storage. On refresh, the previous session's last searched city is rendered.

###User-Story

>AS someone who interacts with the climate everyday
>I WANT to see forecast and relevant climate data for today and the near future
>SO THAT I can dress and plan my week accordingly

###Project Criteria
