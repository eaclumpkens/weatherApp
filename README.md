[launch project](eaclumpkens.github.io/dayplanner/)

In this project I utilized Open Weather API to render current and near future climate data on the user's input of a city name. A search history is automatically updated and rendered, the most recently searched item being saved to local storage. On refresh, the previous session's last searched city is rendered.

### User-Story

AS someone who interacts with the climate everyday
I WANT to see forecast and relevant climate data for today and the near future
SO THAT I can dress and plan my week accordingly
